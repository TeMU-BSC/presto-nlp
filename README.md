路 To init a new project (already initialized - we don't need it anymore), use [rasa init](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/2.x/command-line-interface#rasa-init):

```bash
rasa init
```

路 To train changes in the current model, use [rasa train](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/2.x/command-line-interface#rasa-train) (This command might take some time):

```bash
rasa train
```

路 To test and interact with the trained model, use [rasa shell](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/2.x/command-line-interface#rasa-shell):

```bash
rasa shell
```

路 To test and interact only with the NLU trained model, use [rasa shell nlu](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/2.x/command-line-interface#rasa-shell):

rasa shell nlu
```
