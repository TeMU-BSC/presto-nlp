路 To train the current model, use [rasa train](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/2.x/command-line-interface#rasa-train) (This command might take some time):

```bash
rasa train
```

路 To test and interact with the trained model, use [rasa shell](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/2.x/command-line-interface#rasa-shell):
